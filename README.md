# First-Portfolio

First-Portfolio

This is my First Portfolio and README. In this I have created an HTML and CSS that I will continue to add to throughout my schooling. 

So far I have added enough to create a simple webpage with some areas with my name, about me, my work area (that I will be adding to soon), and contact info.

Within the next 5 months this page will be much larger and nicer than it is right now.
